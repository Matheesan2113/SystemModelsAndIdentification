function [xo,yo] = line_plot(x,y)
%LINE_Plot	line graph.
%	LINE_PLOT(Y) draws a line graph of the elements of vector Y.
%	LINE_PLOT(X,Y) draws a line graph of the elements in vector Y at
%	the locations specified in X.  The X-values must be in
%	ascending order and evenly spaced.
%	[XX,YY] = LINE_PLOT(X,Y) does not draw a graph, but returns vectors
%	X and Y such that PLOT(XX,YY) is the line chart.
%	See also STAIRS and HIST.
